  > Stupidity ... occurs when you don’t have the right conceptual tools for the job. The result is an inability to [[make sense]] of what is happening ...
  > Stupidity has two features that make it particularly dangerous when compared with other vices. 
  > First, unlike character flaws, stupidity is primarily a property of groups or traditions, not individuals: after all, we get most of our concepts ... from ... society ... Once stupidity has taken hold of a group or society, it is thus particularly hard to eradicate ...
  > Second, stupidity begets more stupidity due to a profound ambiguity in its nature ... Take politics, where stupidity is particularly catching: a stupid slogan chimes with a stupid voter, it mirrors the way they see the world. The result is that stupidity can, ironically, be extremely effective in the right environment ... It is vital to separate this point from familiar and condescending claims about how dumb or uneducated the ‘other side’ are: stupidity is compatible with high educational achievement, and it is more the property of a political culture than of the individuals in it ...
  > Imagine someone who had been blind to all evidence that they were being cheated on finally asking themselves ‘How could you be so stupid?’ Here the problem is not pure stupidity: the concept of a cheat is common enough ... It’s not just that they failed to apply the concept of betrayal, but that they literally didn’t think of it: it was effectively ‘offline’, due to emotional and other pressures. In this kind of case, agents possess the necessary intellectual tools but unwittingly lock them away
