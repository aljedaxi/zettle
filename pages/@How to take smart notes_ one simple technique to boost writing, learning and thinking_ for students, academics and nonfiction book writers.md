- systems can only act upon an [[interface]]. your interfaces must be designed to expose the aspects of the system that [should change?]
- TODO what is it to think?
	- an idea is a picture of an aesthetic.
		- ie --- an idea??
		- a note is a picture of an idea?
		- a note is an idea?
- TODO what is the academic mode? a questioning / questing towards \?truth? interesting questions? if so---or if anything like it is so---such a mode must be spread throughout society. every question ever asked may and should be treated with dignity.
- the "good reader" is the reader who understands that a text is a system of purposeful [[Lichtung]]en and occlusions. the "poor reader" sees only that which is lit.
	- the "good reader" is in "dialog" (their reading is dialectical), while the "poor reader" is listening.
	- to "see only that which is lit" is to subconsciously accept the author's system 
	   (of biases?)
- notes that describe subjects are something like research questions
- the software needs to have ways to visualize the connections between notes ; ways of viewing clusters
	- see what is there, what is missing, what questions arise
	- the answer to the question is a next note
	- "do not brainstorm for a topic" [1p29]
- Teachers mistake the following of [[best practices]] for expertise[1p65]. environmental variables are systematically ignored until the situation can be reduced to something [[clear]].
	- what does this say about Kantianism? "an exclusive use of analytical rationality tends to impede further improvement [1p63]".
- '"no, no!" Feynmann protested, "They aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. **I actually did the work on the paper**.[1p91]
- the act of learning is the act of drawing connections. the propositions of the text are made [[meaningful]] through their integration with what the learner already knows.
	- to have forgotten is to not be able to recall; 
	  to be able to recall is to've learned;
	  learning involves systems of recollection
	- a Zettelkasten is a picture of a recollective system
	  a model of "that which is remembered, and how"
- "too much [[order]] can impede learning" [p99] -> ie, too harshly governing constraints. Sense is made through the movement of propositions into [[order]], the construction of clarity.

- the process
- always have something on hand 2 take notes
- whenever you read something that makes you think, note that down with the bibliographic data
- forEach idea you've noted, explain it well enough that anyone can read it. full sentences, references.
- add that note to the slipbox. link it to related notes, your index, and notes that describe subjects.
