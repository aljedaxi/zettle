- the "good reader" is the reader who understands that a text is a system of purposeful [[Lichtung]]en and occlusions. the "poor reader" sees only that which is lit.
	- the "good reader" is in "dialog" (their reading is dialectical), while the "poor reader" is listening.

  	-> "do not brainstorm for a topic" [1p29]

"an exclusive use of analytical rationality tends to impede further improvement [1p63]".
