  systems can only act upon an interface. your interfaces must be designed to expose the aspects of the system that [should change?]
  
  what is it to think?
  
  what is the form of the idea?
  
  what is the academic mode? a questioning / questing towards \?truth? interesting questions? if so---or if anything like it is so---such a mode must be spread throughout society. every question ever asked may and should be treated with dignity.
  
  the "good reader" is the reader who understands that a text is a system of purposeful [[Lichtung]]en and occlusions. the "poor reader" sees only that which is lit.
   -> the "good reader" is in "dialog" (their reading is dialectical), while the "poor reader" is listening.
   -> to "see only that which is lit" is to subconsciously accept the author's system 
   (of biases?)
  
   an idea is a picture of an aesthetic.
    -> ie --- an idea??
  	-> a note is a picture of an idea?
  	-> a note is an idea?
  
  "and one is the myth of the [tabula rasa] itself" [1p10]
  
  notes that describe subjects are something like research questions
  
  the software needs to have ways to visualize the connections between notes ; ways of viewing clusters
  	-> see what is there, what is missing, what questions arise
  	-> the answer to the question is a next note
  	-> "do not brainstorm for a topic" [1p29]
- the process
- always have something on hand 2 take notes
- whenever you read something that makes you think, note that down with the bibliographic data
- forEach idea you've noted, explain it well enough that anyone can read it. full sentences, references.
- add that note to the slipbox. link it to related notes, your index, and notes that describe subjects.
