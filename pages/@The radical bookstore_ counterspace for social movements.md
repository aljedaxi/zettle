- [[Abstract]]
	- "Examines how radical bookstores and similar spaces serve as launching pads for social movements"--
- [[Definitions]]
	- A [[counterspace]] is
	  > "an initially utopian alternative to actually existing 'real' space," which people insert into the landscape "in opposition to het one embodied in the strategies of power." 
	  or
	  > "spaces of restistance to the dominatnt order arising precisely from their subordinate, peripheral, or marginalized positioning."
	  or 
	  > the spatial infrastructure activists constrctuct for themselves to accommodate contenious poliicatl tpractices operating in par
	- A [[counterpublic]] is
	  > a diverse public realm where different social groups do not necessarily try to speak as one. Instead, counterpublics are "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counter discourses to formulate oppositional interpretations of their itentites, interests and needs."
	- A [[counterconduct]] is
	  > "the pursuit of a different form of conduct: to be led differently, by other [women and] men, and towards other objectives than those proposed by the apparent and visible governmentality of society." Counterconducts ... do not reject governing. Instead, they recode the social systems assigning meaning to beliefs, objects, and behaviours.

  > After the film screening, chairs are cleared away to make room for a party; the morning after the party, the space is cleaned up to hold a discussion or writing workshop, which in turn makes way for a baking session.

  > I developed the term "[[print-based movement space]]" as an umbrella term to define activist enterprises combining these three elements: place, text and activism.
	-
	  > my analysis focuses primarily on space ... for text, Kristin Hogan's *Feminist Bookstore Movement* and Nicholas Thoburn's *Anti-book* analyze print objects as tools for organizing ... For activism, Doug McAdam's et al's *Dynamics of Contention* and Charles Tilly's *Contentious Performances* analyze the [[performative]] aspects of social movements repertoires.
- TODO every [[counterspace]] should have an ad-blocker & some sort of anonimizer in front of their router
