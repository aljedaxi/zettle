- [[Abstract]]
	- "Examines how radical bookstores and similar spaces serve as launching pads for social movements"--
-
  > After the film screening, chairs are cleared away to make room for a party; the morning after the party, the space is cleaned up to hold a discussion or writing workshop, which in turn makes way for a baking session.

-
  > I developed the term "[[print-based movement space]]" as an umbrella term to define activist enterprises combining these three elements: place, text and activism.
	-
	  > my analysis focuses primarily on space ... for text, Kristin Hogan's *Feminist Bookstore Movement* and Nicholas Thoburn's *Anti-book* analyze print objects as tools for organizing ... For activism, Doug McAdam's et al's *Dynamics of Contention* and Charles Tilly's *Contentious Performances* analyze the [[performative]] aspects of social movements repertoires.
