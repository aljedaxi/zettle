- [[Abstract]]
	- "Examines how radical bookstores and similar spaces serve as launching pads for social movements"--
-
  > I developed the term "[[print-based movement space]]" as an umbrella term to define activist enterprises combining these three elements: place, text and activism.
	-
	  > my analysis focuses primarily on space ... for text, Kristin Hogan's *Feminist Bookstore Movement* and Nicholas Thoburn's *Anti-book*
