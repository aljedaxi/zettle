- [[Abstract]]
	- in the trend towards distributed networks, we should look to nature for best practices. as Bittorrent, Bitcoin, Ethereum rise in popularity, i can't help but wonder: where in nature do we find one flat network for the entire world? where in nature do we find global consensus? we don't, and we should be designing our distributed networks to match the designs that are found in nature. in this talk i'll go over these design principles with examples from scuttlebot / Patchwork.
