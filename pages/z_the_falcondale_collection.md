  - Session 1
  - 
  > the whole essence of Cybernetics is the lesson of never do anything until you know the result of your last action
  - 
  > that word steersman appears in Homer, Plato uses it for regulation in societies. .. in Latin ... Greek Kappa turns into a G a harder sound and out of Kybernetes you get gubernator
  - 
  > intrinsic regulation. The regulation is in the system.
  the trick is to build governance into the system
	-
	  > Cybernetics ... the science of control and communication in the animal and machine
- animal and machine implies that the two use the same mechanisms
- implies control is a function of comms, & even that they're the same
	- Stories
		- Ashby and decision making
		  
		  > Ashby ... "Well I would have thought you would have said, give me three months and I'll list all the pros and cons and then make a balanced judgement". 
		  > ... "What, have you taken leave of your senses. ... It's an impossible assignment ... ". "It's difficult, I know, I've been trying to do that myself after all. Why did you just say yes?" 
		  > " ... if you don't have enough information" ... "you obey hunch, now, the brain is a complicated piece of machinery and might produce the right answer. I can't account for it. My brain said do it, so I did." ... "okay say you don't have a hunch, what is  the second most obvious thing to do." 
		  > He looked at me most pityingly and said "you toss a coin". It is  the only rational thing to do.
		- The Fourth Layer of the visual cortex
		  
		  > McCulloch walked into the common room of this place in the evening and there was Norbert Weiner sitting there, reading and Warren said ... you've got all these blind people who can't see, I'm trying to make a machine to enable them to read with their ears
		  > ... scan the print with a photo-electric cell which ... is going to encounter this I when this line is broken it makes a sound and when it encounters the 1 this line is broken it makes a different sound.
		  > ... If we have The solids are photo electric cells and the circles are oscillators. You set up a  vibration between a  photo electric cell and oscillator ... this is not a circuit you see. It is a schematic diagram of how you would do this. 
		  > Warren pours himself a  large whisky ... Goes off to bed, and leaves the drawing on the table. Now in comes Gerhardt von Bonin ... He picks this up and says to Norbert Weiner "whose been trying to make a diagram of the fourth visual layer of the cortex?"
		  > Weiner ... [the] next time the group got together for one of their regular evening meetings ... said he could make a mathematical analysis of this so called machine or this so called bit of brain if I knew the rate at which nerve impulses are coming up here if I  could quantify the diagram in short. So various people say I've spent a lifetime doing that I can tell you that the impulses come in and they did quantify the diagram. Weiner did the maths and he said I can now tell you what the scanning rhythm has to be.
		  > It's ten cycles. What is that? ... the alpha state of the brain. Which is the resting rhythm of the brain. Which has solemnly scanning this stuff at ten cycles per second.
	-
	  > ... they talked a lot at night
	  > ... the things that matter most to science, to philosophy, to human race are issues which fall between the stools of established subjects
	  > ... university is supposed to be that it is universal, it  is holistic and you couldn't find a  more reductionist and non-holistic place
	  > ... what sort of topic might pervade everything and not be recognised because of this reductionism. They came up with the notion of control.
		- does liberalism render analysis of control taboo?
		-
		  > Einstein's great problem, if I  may say that about the great man, was precisely that he wasn't inter-disciplinary at all ... You see the answer to that is you need to be a logician to answer that the answer to that is God is the dice, and there is no problem any longer.
- Session 2

	  > I worked a lot for the native Indians in Canada, who are faced with this kind of systemic dilemma ... we are [[guilt]]y of genocide which isn't a very good start because people are terribly guilty ...
	  > ... what percentage of this enormous amount of money do you think is  spent on administration?" ... 85%.
	-
	  > The Jacquard Loom ... that was responsible of course for all the revolts under the name of Luddites.
	- People didn't know much about Turing in the 90s
	-
	  > The so-called Leo machine which was the office machine. The first computer was run in Manchester University, and it  beat the Americans to it because the American machine didn't have storage
	-
	  > Grey Walter ... was the man who invented the mechanical tortoise ... Mechinaspeculartrix ... You imagine a little thing like this, looking like a ouiji board, with three wheels. You have two wheels on the back which drive the thing, with a little electric motor and one wheel on the front which swivels round ... On top of the front wheel is a photo cell again. This thing now has an eye with one input, either this photo cell is firing or it isn't. So it's like a periscope. This means that if you shine a light at this thing it will follow you. ... Now it is  following the light with its periscope and it hits something and it short circuits the shell against the chassis. Turns the photo cell into an oscillator, the result is that, the engine starts reversing and going forward and it  feels its way round the obstruction. You lead it into the furniture, deliberately and then it works its way round it and comes after you again. Now, with only have two cells. We've got a very biological looking machine on our hands ... he put an ordinary torch bulb a  low circuit thing on a  battery inside the shell which tested the circuits so that if the machine was still active when it  stopped, then the light came on ... Here are two  machines, wandering about, they hit each other, so they retreat at the moment they're still, both their lights come therefore, the two photo cells ... this is a courting dance. Any decent biologist would tell you that these things were about to mate.
		-
		  > It's interesting, such a simple little thing, is so out of keeping with what we think of as machines
	-
	  > Cartesian philosophy dominated the French culture. Was the ultimately reductionist thing. The French have been hugely conditioned by this reduction approach.
	-
	  > Now how are you going to define the railways of Canada as a system? ... What is a railway? If I don't even own all this hardware what is  it actually about ... So as soon as you start thinking about the real systemic character of this. You are trying to sell tickets to people who want to go from A to B and nothing of that has anything to do with the railway, except that at some point between A and B there may be a chunk of railway that you can use ... If you want to take the train, you're going to have to get to the station then get transport at the other end. That's what I mean by a  system. You are looking at the operational reality of what you are trying to do and not what somebody says to you is "Oh there's the railway" ... What I'm arguing is  that we are always dealing with little bits of what is the relevant system because it's convenient, and it's convenient to measure it  in terms of money ... What we have to do is loosen up our notions of what a system might be and look at the reality. Look at the operational reality.

- Session 3
	- Traditional managerial science has the problem of trying to measure "Men, Materials, Machinery and Money"; of course, all those are relevant only insofar as they are the things which become complexly intertangled
	  id:: 607cda8c-9ebd-429b-bba0-93987f4b52b5
	-
	  > how many states can you distinguish?
	- "The System" is epistemological
	  The Observer is a part of the system
	- In the 30s, Einstein was considered insane
	-
	  > So you can be a ... a Marxist ... and none of them work. So one of the things I  became kind of famous for was attacking the business schools. .. They are all teaching one thing in common. It is that none of the teaching works.
	-
	  > Why do you think that management and unions never agree about anything. It is because they are talking about quite different systems with quite different VARIETIES.
	-
	  > If I got up, and held up a coat a rather unusual, let's say it  is  very small or very big. I say I have got this coat its going begging. How do we know who will fit this coat. Somebody might say, That is  a large coat I'm 6'5" it may fit me, or somebody could say that is  a small coat I'm only small. Let me try it  on. We say that kind of thing, don't we? The VARIETIES are being handled without counting, that's my point. ... when I said measure I don't mean count, necessarily ...
	-
	  > An Exercise in WHAT - the problem 
	  
	  > You have been appointed manager of a  shop engaged in jobbing production, and have been finding out the form - which is  pretty awful. Some shifts go well; but on others two types of difficulty arise, either separately or together. One difficulty is  that a shift may throw up a loss compared with standard; the other is that a  dissident faction of work people may decide to cause trouble - and that consumes too much energy in handling the wild cat strike threat. 
	  
	  > It turns out that there are two matters under your control that bear on this. Some work attracts a  bonus rate, and the loading of this work can be manipulated. It seems to be generally accepted on the shop floor that more than 30% bonus work is  'good' while less is  'bad'. There is another and unpleasant kind of job which you can always run (or not); this, according to agreements, involves a flat 10% extra payment for the whole shift. 
	  
	  > The production director has said that when you start on Monday you must operate this system as best you may. But until delicate negotiations at a higher level are completed he would like to see as little trouble as possible. So you set to work to discover what actually happens - and it follows a definite pattern. 
	  
	  > If there is smooth working (i.e. no dissidents) on a  shift, it  will continue on the next shift unless the proportion of bonus work is bad. Then there is trouble, unless it  is clear that the previous shift made a  loss - in which case the trouble makers make no headway, because the earlier loss realistically explains the bad bonus. Indeed, if the bonus is good following a loss making shift, trouble will certainly break out while people argue what the management is up to. 
	  
	  > If there is  trouble on a  shift, then that too goes on into the next shift, even when the bonus is good and the extra payment is  made, if the first shift made a profit. But there is  an interesting exception to this; if the extra payment work is not put in, this seems to be taken as a sign that the order book is  falling and that men may be laid of. At any rate the trouble stops. When the trouble shift also makes a loss, then this weakens the dissidents' hand, and there is  no trouble on the next shift - provided that the extra payment is put in. 
	  
	  > Given a  profitable shift, the dissidents will see to it  that the next shift makes a  loss, unless there was also trouble on the first shift. In that case trouble making is apparently too dangerous -  because it  doesn't happen, unless both the bonus is bad and there is no extra payment, when the dissidents will get away with trouble making again. 
	  
	  > After a loss making shift on the other hand the next shift turns out to be profitable so long as there was no trouble in the first shift, these dissidents are very careful, because if there was the loss would certainly continue. However this whole situation is  inevitably reversed if the extra payment is not made, again this appears to be taken as a dangerous sign in some circumstances (if not others).
	  
	  > Its all terribly complicated and your hands are tied so this is certainly not an exercise in industrial relations, so you must not interfere with those, but you do have a guarantee that the shop floor will respond true to form. What is this an exercise in? Then can you solve the problem? Is there anything you can do to ensure making a profit and have smooth running as well. I'll tell you this much, we can work out from the state of affairs from the last shift on Friday night that your first shift on Monday morning is bound (a) to be an uproar and (b) to make a loss. Congratulations on the new job.
	  
	  > Its an exercise not in accounting or man management because that's all taken out of it. But it's still very complicated. Is an exercise in complexity.
	  
	  > I always put this to my undergraduate students and I offer a bottle of wine for the first person to give me the answer and every year for the past five years someone has done it. So there is  a challenge for you.
- Session 4
	-
	  > I have had many arguments with economists about the nature of inflation because, it seems to me that from a  non cybernetic point of view that they regard inflation as a  fire breathing dragon who is stalking up and down the streets which has to be shot or dealt with in some way. Whereas I  see inflation from a  systemic point of view as essentially a  measure of the extent to which the poor are getting better off than the rich. You think about that because you see the rich are loosing value because of inflation and somebody with no money couldn't care less about inflation, obviously. If you've got nothing who cares! So that is a  very different insight. I  was nearly hanged from a  lamppost in Oxford, about 30 years ago for saying this.
	-
	  > Rwanda ...
	  > The awful things about those situations, from my observations, that is never mentioned, is that people settle personal scores. Too bad he's dead, you know, a rather wicked thought. 
	  > That's just like unpopular  officers get killed in war. Too bad what a  pity let's hope nobody finds the bullet in the back.
	-
	  > Hegel ... a systems thinker ... He had a thing which he called the axiom of internal relations ... which says that the relations by which terms are related and are an integral part of the terms they relate ... And what this means is that a  mouse is smaller than an elephant or it  wouldn't be a  mouse ... We like to think that we are accounting for things that are going on in nature but what we are really accounting is a  linguistic model of that ...
		-
		  > Now there are obviously, like when we said that defining the boundaries of the system is immensely difficult, defining the boundaries of viability, is immensely difficult
		  
		  > Identity. So a  viable system has an identity and maybe that is one of the problems that I was having with the tides you see. It is  an identifiable thing which we are talking about which can sustain itself and if it eventually dies as we shall.
		  
		  > ... a company ... Take Harrods for example, been around a longer than all its clients and all its staff
	-
	  > I have a law ... all viable systems contain and are contained in viable system ... So you suddenly get this extraordinary image of the viable system called you, at the centre of something like a  sphere. Where your organs are part of you and you are part of the family. Something else is  part of you and you are part of the church and so on. And there are hundreds of them that's why I call it a sphere, I think it's a nice model. It's amazing really when you start to think about it. And this linear causal chain that I  was attacking yesterday, makes you pretend you are not that complicated because they say Oh well that's just me, you know. And I have signed on or whatever you've done. It's very boring but this rich thing like this sphere with no boundaries out here sort of shimmering away that is you
- Session 5
	-
	  > Organisation Chart, the only use of this thing is to find out who you can blame
	- A system can only be viable relative to its environment.
	  An organ is only viable relative to the rest of the body
	-
	  > System One is to be identified as what is  going on that makes the viable system what it is
	- Stafford conceives of the VSM as pairs,
	  (people (squads (platoons (legions (army))))) or whatever
	- In terms of [[variety]], $$E \supset S_1 \supset S_M$$ so what stafford draws a bunch of attenuator arrows [attenuator symbol](http://www.electronicshub.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/attenuator.jpg){:height 22, :width 22} like $$E$$ to $$S_1$$ & $$S_1$$ to $$S_M$$; thence, amplifier arrows [amplifier symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Amplifier_symbol.svg/1024px-Amplifier_symbol.svg.png){:height 20, :width 20} from $$E \triangleleft S_1 \triangleleft S_M$$.
	- if something is in homeostasis, there's no issue. you're a nice, synchronous, black box;
	- what you're trying to measure is stability; your goal is to maintain stability

	  > my definition of information is 'what changes us'. Up to then the stuff is  data. Data is  useless, until its transmogrified into something that changes you
	-
	  > A few years ago Allenna and I  were appointed by the United Nations as consultants to the President of Uruguay. This is a  dear delightful man, a  lawyer whose name is Dr. Julio Sanganeti, who is  no longer President because they are now working on a constitutional basis and last a few years and then replaced. He was replacing a military hunta, which had been in there for 12 years and committed mayhem. And he had all these problems about amnesties. Everywhere you go you get this problem in the third world. If everybody in this room has had a  loved one tortured and killed the first thing you want to do, is wreak vengeance on the bastards who did it. But you see, the military are sitting there waiting to take over again at a drop of a hat. So you can't suddenly start trying all the generals and hang them. Its an awfully difficult situation, I've seen this over and over again. Well Sanganeti was faced with that, but that's another story. What I was getting to is what can you measure. Now, I looked for things that I could pick up in real time that can be totally instability, I was explaining this. I was in Sanganeti's office explaining this to him, Allenna by my side, and he said 'Well I think I've got a pretty good team in the presidential office, I would like you to look at this'. And he went over and got a book and he showed me this book. And he said 'This isn't out of date Stafford, you can see that this is  this week'. And it  shows the main indicators. Now that's the word that everybody uses you see, the indicators, the PE ratio in business, the rate of foreign exchange and these kind of things in Government. And I said, 'Well yes this is very good,' And I was honest, I said 'I don't think I've seen a better set of Government statistics geared to the point where the president can actually read it, rather than masses of bumph'. 'But you see,' I said 'I'm looking for something more sensitive than these standard indexes'. And he looked at me and said, 'I'm going to risk this,' he said, 'Tum to the back of the book.' And I turned to the back of the book. He said, 'These figures I ask for every day, and everybody thinks I'm mad. But I've got a hunch you wont'. The sale of bus tickets, the sale of milk, I could have kissed him I mean this is exactly what I am talking about. If the sale of bus tickets fall off from the norm it means that people aren't going to work. If the bus tickets fall off you ... Ah I thought its wonderful. Now then, the conclusion of this story is, I went again with Allenna, into his office one day. And he was more or less leaping around waving newspapers and he said, 'Have you seen the newspapers?' 'Yes, we've seen the newspapers'. Now the newspapers said, I forget exactly how long he had been in office. It might have been 9 months or a year. Perhaps. it was a year. The newspapers reviewing the year had discovered that his policies were working, so there are all the indicators of the foreign exchange, and deficit was better, the trade gap is  better and all this jazz. And he said, 'Well it  shows you, this media thing that we have often talked about. I knew that we were on the right course nine months ago, and now they have finally caught up, and they are telling the people that it's worked'. And I said, 'Yes, well that's the usual lag, but well done Mr. President'. And we were sort of drinking to that when Allenna, who had been thinking a bit in the background said 'excuse me president, if you knew this nine months ago, why didn't everybody else? And it can't just be that it  hasn't seeped through the media'. And he said to her, 'Oh I knew, because of one of my special things in the back of the book'., and he went and got it. What do you think that it  was? The consumption of electricity on a  daily basis, after three months, pheee. It meant that everybody was getting back to work. And he said, 'I knew that when I saw this huge thing, that it was working. But nobody thinks it  out for another .... '  And he said to me, he said to us, 'Do you realise that my Government could have fallen a dozen times in the last 9 months, because nobody knew this except me'. Now, these are very telling arguments aren't they. You see what it  means is  that you've got to change the whole style of management. This is why we don't get anywhere. Because, you call in consultants and they do their thing and they paste over the cracks and you've had some. Obviously, I can see by the smirk on your face.
	-
	  > You've got the firms of consultants, who increasingly you notice, are accountants.
	-
	  > The channel itself has to have requisite [[variety]] 
	  requisite bandwidth
	-
	  > If you are in a book shop and your trying to decide whether you want to buy this book. Negate sentences at random. See if they are worth it, and you soon find that practically everything in the book is meaningless. Because you couldn't possibly say the opposite. It's a  very good test, I  really commend it to you.
	-
	  > Transducer - Latin - transducerai -  lead across
	- whenever you cross the boundary, (between $$E$$ & $$S_1$$ &c.) you're dealing with transduction
- Session 6
	- the entirety of system one is a battery of viable systems, lined up as such:
	  $$E \leftrightarrow S_1 \leftrightarrow M$$
		- if one envisions them as stacked vertically, the battery absorbs [[variety]] by leveling the environment through expectation. If you talk to someone in america about McDondald, it's likely going to be same as if you talk to someone about it in Sweden.
		- we can thence envision a red and blue line running through the battery of $$M$$s; finally, we have a green line running between $$\{E, S_1\}$$
- The red line is a circuit that communicates the ethical and legal constraints of the operation
- The blue line is a circuit that communicates a resource bargain: i want $$x$$, and you want me to get $$y$$ out of it.
- The green line is a circuit of auditing: you talk to the manager and the worker and say "have we over amplified our [[variety]]?"
	- if the system isn't falling apart, we know that $$\{E,S_1,M\}$$ all have requisite [[variety]]; however, that tells us nothing about the vertical interchange of variety
	- in what sense is the totality of the health system a system?
- all doctors have the same education; a certain solidarity; the same language; linked fax machines; a shared understanding of how to work
	- each station on an assembly line is it's own viable system, which is liked by the assembly line!
	- so the people at the top are like "oh we're very liberal, i don't really do anything up here, if someone at the bottom wants to do something they can just like do it yeah? why am i here?"; you go and talk to the person at the bottom and they hate their job, saying "you can't do anything without going through 18.5 layers of bureaucracy."
	  : this speaks to the way in which the [[variety]] of the system interplays with the [[variety]] of the metasystem
	-
	  > What is  really going to determine the purpose is  the ethos that the top management manages to create in the place. Are we an ethical show do we care about the environment and so on. All the big oil company have whole departments now, working on the green thing. Making films, proving that they're not spoiling the environment and so on and that's enough isn't it? As long as you can con everybody into thinking that that is  okay, you can go and spoil the environment until you are blue in the face. Now where is  the actual purpose here. The actual purpose is  to rip off the planet.
- Session 7
	-
	  > you have to keep the levels of recursion in mind, the ministry is going to be embedded in the whole system of government
	-
	  > and i hope you realize from this argument that autonomy is a relative thing, not an absolute
	- system two can be thought of as a little spinal cord that runs along the battery of systems ones
		-
		  > All these are Ones. System Two exists precisely to control oscillatory behaviour between the Systems' One. And you will notice that it isn't a command function ... anything that damps [[oscillation]]
		-
		  > Yes, the timetable, is the thing that stops everybody arriving in one place simultaneously and saying, 'Please Sir, Miss told us to come here!' ... and I have never met a teacher who has said, 'I'm victimised by the Timetable, I'm not allowed to do my thing', for that reason. ... The timetable is obviously a  service, and if you are a teacher and have to go to the dentist in a hurry you look at the timetable and you say to your friend
		-
		  > And the individual divisions or sub-companies, whatever they are going to be inside that, pursuing the public image, they design letterhead ... Nominate somebody, each of you, please, to a  committee to discuss this and we'll hire the best designer we can think of and between them they come up with something and it  is  passed around
		-
		  > *So in Parliament is the System Two the procedures?* ... And the Whips office you see is going to be ... [but] a lot of Parliamentarians regard the Whips as Fascist Bastards and they're not supposed to be. They are supposed to be there to smooth business, so that's a  very nice example.
		- and Stafford draws a little traingle at every column of the spinal cord
		  > These are local Production Controllers that **owe some sort of allegiance** to this [system] one ... but **also an allegiance across here** [top triangle of system two].
		-
		  > The amoeba for environments, the circle for process, the square for the management and this triangle this way up for anti-oscillatory behaviour ... now the green line has the triangle the other way up [ie down] and looks like that. And that is System Three Star
	- System 3
		-
		  > System Three ... exists precisely because it  has the overall view and that is  where you are going to find all the management techniques that are known a optimising techniques
		-
		  > I don't think anything can improve upon them. Schools of course. You can optimise. You try to get a group of classes together. You see this very much in Further Education, Allenna teaches a lot in the Further Education System and she doesn't know from one year to the next whether she will have a class where she had it last year, because it  may get dissolved in the process of trying to optimise the budget. It depends on how many people come, and where the subsidy is  coming from and whether the class is paying, it's all that mix, is going to give you a  System Three problem.
		-
		  > [with system 3] we are running into Senior Management compared with Local Management ... System Two dependent upon System Three [as] That's where it's going to get its authority from and so is System Three Star
		-
		  > System Three Star ... is going to summon up these Audits that we were talking about
		-
		  > And you'll notice that they are all autonomic. Now that's a nice word because the Greek here is 'self' of course, auto, nomos is law
		-
		  > We can't afford to take time off to remember to make our hearts pump or breathe. If we did we wouldn't be able to pay any attention ... That is  an autonomic function and it goes on and it's got requisite variety built into it. On the other hand if I say there is my bus I must catch it. I can go like that. Suck in a load of oxygen, **totally interfering with the [[autonomy]] of the respiration system**, you notice ... Now, in our management model, you can intervene in that, if you're the top management and have got a good reason and think you can handle it, you can intervene. And of course most of our industrial troubles and management troubles arise because of people intervening in things that they should damn well leave alone, or things where they don't understand the effects of their intervention
		-
		  > It is regulatory power on behalf of the people who are policing the roads, and trying to make the system work, it's an attenuator of people who would like to drive willy nilly. Quite right
	- System 4
		-
		  > My defence of the Three and Four division is  that it is  very biological. If you look at biological systems like the body as I said Three, Two, One is the autonomic nervous system and is understandable as such. Four is easily understandable as the whole sensory system and the mid brain and limbic system, so called, that sits on top of the old part of the brain. Now the, this stuff ends about here ... [Stafford points to the back of his neck] it's the spinal chord ending in the medulla pons and the bulb at the top and the cerebellum which is the thing which keeps you upright and stops you from falling over and so on with a  bit of luck, hopefully. That is  the old part of the brain, then we develop this new thing, which gives us foresight, which most animals don't have so you see, so that's a natural division. If you look at whole species, you find that the reproductive system, is in there to keep the species going beyond the individuals. And that really is a  rather separate system from the one that keeps the individual alive. So I argue that, if you've got to make a break this is a rather clever and sensible and understandable way of doing it. And so, I come along with System Four.
		-
		  > Now please realise that this is not a hierarchy. Because it's drawn like its drawn, people think it's a hierarchy, it was never intended to be a hierarchy.
		- Each system one deals with a subset of the environment, not only in terms of space, but in terms of how it deals with that subset of the space. systems one deals with the environment insofar as it can use it to achieve its aims in the here and now. System 4 is looking at perhaps that same space, in terms of how that space is going to change, which means that it's looking to the change makers, the systems four of other viable systems,

You're trying to stop oscillating behaviour. It's no use sending somebody out of this line into the next line without a  hard hat if he is going to have rocks dropped on his head. You know there has to be a  uniform understanding through the company, of what is  safe practice in our kind of industry

	  > Buggy Whip Syndrome
	  > Here is a manufacturer of buggy whips. A buggy is  a  little horse drawn cart and this great long whip, you know. He improves his machinery, improves his leather, does all the right things. Cuts his cost, can't understand why he's making a loss. He doesn't happen to notice that buggies are going out and motor cars are taking over. Now this is  a very serious problem and no body mentioned Corporate Planning as a name when we were talking about what's in System Four. But probably that's the most important thing.

	  > As one technology takes over from another (Stafford gets up to diagram) again payoff time, what happens is  that a  new technology comes along and you investigate and it  doesn't pay off for some time. Not much anyway. It's flat. Then it begins to grow like the clappers and then it fades away. Why does it fade away, because a new technology is  overtaking it  and that is going to be more expensive and it's going to start like this and then it's going to do that. There is the interesting question. If you are soaked in technology A as IPC was in paper and ink in the mode of publishing, and you can see electronics coming along behind which is  the blue line, at what point do you level off your investment in paper and ink and research associated with it, and start investing in the electronic version?
	  > Beer's law of economics which said the cross over point happens two years after I retire as a Director of this Company
	-
	  > Is to say You guys on the board who are supposed to monitor the homeostat if you don't get that balance right the Company will blow up. The same goes for the country, you know, if the Government doesn't make the right investments and so much R & D is sponsored by the Government now, either directly or indirectly, because Companies can't spend money on R & D unless the Government hasn't bought six million aircraft or whatever it is going to do. The thing is  enormously artificial and yet we like to pretend we live in a market economy and the whole thing is  as screwed as possible. This gives System 5 a very peculiar role, it  seems to me, and I believe that most of it  has to do with the ethos of the Company and what counts as good behaviour. If the Directors of the Company are seen to be rip-off artists it  will go right through the Company, like that. This is  how corruption happens in countries as you know you get some dictator set up in a banana republic who orders gold bed and rides around in Cadillacs and people say Oh yes, we are in on this too. Just goes through the whole system like canker.

It includes everybody who has a  stake in whatever that includes customers, suppliers and the village and the works. It is so hold-all; it's a portmanteau; catchall is the English word, perhaps it's no use. Maybe you need to itemise those things.

	-
	  > The pattern that emerged from this was absolutely amazing, I must do it  again some time, or you do it if you get the chance. Everybody thinks that somebody else is  doing System 4  . "You see, I am a down to earth man and I call a spade a spade and I'm 3". Or "I'm a bit more important than 3  I'm a 5". "He's the intellectual he knows about computers they're doing 4 somehow". You find out that there is  this huge gap, there is no 4'ness in the system. I just want to end with this very dramatic statement, if 4 doesn't effectively exist (Stafford gets up to diagram) which is  often the case either because people don't know about it properly or because they don't get the focus. Let's pretend it's not there. Now look at this huge superstructure 5 collapses into 3 there is  nothing to hold it up. This is borne out. The people in 5 used to be in 3 and they've been given their peerage so they are up here and very uncomfortable because they don't know what they are doing so they have got to collapse into 3.

You can take the cat's brain out down to the level of 3 and keep the poor little devil alive with intravenous injections. He's all right, you poke his leg and there is a  reflex action. That's it. That's the state of an awful lot of our management. It just response to stimuli and usually the wrong response at that, because we don't have the meta-system in place.

	  > the very very eminent Chilean biologist Humberto Maturana ... said it's nothing to do with self-reproduction. It's to do with self-production
		-
		  > that self-reproduction is  a special case of autopoiesis, that one of the things you do to make yourself is  to have offspring to take over once you've died. So, the notion of autopoiesis is really much more fundamental
	-
	  > Now, I have now got a solution to this. The element of the viable system which produces itself is  system 1, and in support of that function are 2,3,4 and 5.
	-
	  > I invented the even worse term, and I would love a better one, of pathological autopoiesis which is  a terrible great mouthful to stand for a viable system in which either or all of systems 2,3,4 and 5 were running amok trying to be viable systems ... an awful lot that's going wrong today I think in our kind of society because bureaucracy does get the upper hand
	-
	  > So how can you get structure in a group of 30 people without hierarchy when you don't want people to pull rank or gender or anything. You want to treat them as human beings. Well now, the answer to this would seem to be ... you close the system round in a three dimensional space so that you've got something like a ball. And you roll a ball along the ground, obviously there's no top to this ball, or sideways, or bottom or anything, it's just the ball. Now, so we have something available to us that has that kind of character. The answer is  the icosahedron.
	-
	  > thirty people ... one person is a side ... the nodes are going to be the topics under discussion ... twelve decent statements ... any one person is connected to two of those statements and is part of two teams therefore of five each ... that means we are controlling variety already because she hasn't got to be on twelve committees, she's on two committees ... [and is]  a critic of two more ... you are now dealing with four of the nodes in two different capacities out of a total of 12 quite directly, two as team members, two as critics ...
	-
	  > In nature, compression is  always matched by something else. What do you think that is? tension
		-
		  > Take a tug of war team both of whom are pulling like mad so this rope is  in tension, well where is the compression there doesn't seem to be any? But you see, if before the team starts you wiggle your finger between the strands of the rope before they pull it, you'll soon find out where the compression is. It'll have your finger off. And that is  a beautiful example of the way the natural system mixes it.
		-
		  > So, I said to myself now here's my organisation of 30 people held together primarily by compressive strength, what shall I do about the tension ... What I joined together were these two ... these connections must be recognised as tensile components of the system, so I called them critics

	  > what we need now is  what I call a **protocol** that is to say a way of conducting affairs with this model which will enable all these things to happen
	-
	  > I have fought  all my life against the standard way of running meetings because you have to choose an agenda, and when you've got the agenda you more or less determine the outcome of the meeting especially if you know all the people, you put all the agenda in a certain order and a good secretary can write the minutes before the meeting is held
	-
	  > So the idea is to discover out of them what it is going to be worth cracking it so we start with something that I call the filter of importance ... I say to you OK before we go to bed everybody write down something that matters on a card; and if you are brilliant and had two ideas that matter ... When I am doing this I say "Pray" ... but it's not the usual thing you meet on the agenda ... 30 people when you do this at night and you say do this before you go to bed tend to generate about 130 statements which means that people are averaging 4 point something each ... quite a high variety arrangement given that they are not going to be boring ...  I have a very special trick for trying to ensure that ... negate it right? .. Now, while you are all asleep, the staff will have to do something with all this mass of material and will shove it  all into computers and at breakfast time next morning you will have the complete list ... Now, what you are invited to do is  seize a table on which there is a kind of flag pole and suppose you are dead keen on one of these statements ... You write on the flag "pray" or ... "Ban men" ... Then you sit at the table and invite business ... there is  only one rule about the problem jostle, that is  to say there is no politeness that it's understood that you will walk around and leave groups and you don't have to make excuses ... Now, out of this we try to get what we call agglomerated statements of importance ... we know we've got to end up with 12 but we're not trying to force things at this stage but we're trying to shrink the variety and contain variety ... Then that usually ends up with about 25 ... somewhere between 20 and 30 so the variety is  being attenuated ... And we have voting procedures we say well now folks these are the topics will you rank them ... Josephine has developed an algorithm ... typically she's getting 95 or 93 percent of the desirable outcome ... at the end of each iteration you've got 12 statements and they change the next iteration .... the same topics .... but now the content changes you see until you end up with the optimal statement at the end ... to take a day over each iteration which is  three days and you have to add a day for the problem jostle and then all the hexadic reduction staff and then a day at the end to deal with it all. Then you've got a week

	  > some higher level perception is  emerging that we've generated and that all share in and if you want a 3-4 homeostat
	-
	  > However, by computing the eigenvalues in this actually computing what they are I can demonstrate that 90% of information will have been shared after 3 iterations; after 4 it's about 92%; after 5 it's 95%; ... _So, I cut it at 3 because that's the formal mathematical statement that 90% of it  has happened and that's a theory about this now given that all the people are real people, and talking and having lunch and so on I think we make up the extra 10% fairly easily in practice
	-
	  > Oh good gracious .... that depends why you are using it. I think if the company does that in the 3-4 homeostat that's going to kick the company off on a new track and then you've got to monitor that behaviour and then you say it's time for another. Well we haven't had it long enough to know what that will be but I shouldn't think more than once a year is  .... makes any sense at all
	-
	  > Now another group of doctoral students are trying to deal with using other platonic solids than the icosahedron but unfortunately the mathematics isn't nearly as satisfying
	-
	  > Now, what do you do if you've got 150 people. I've done that; you try and hold 5 syntegrations ... you're all familiar with the idea of recursion by now ... Suppose each one of these [struts] is an icosahedron ... when you've held it, you've got 12 statements. Suppose you pull this icosa apart until it becomes a thin line and align the statements as best you may .... so 5 statements get amalgamated here and 7 get amalgamated here (pointing to the two ends of the strut), lets say. Ideally, six and six I suppose; and then that becomes a strut at the next level of recursion ... You do that 4 times and you involve two and a half million people. How to run a country? It becomes plausible, doesn't it?
