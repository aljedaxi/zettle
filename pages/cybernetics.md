  Cybernetics was very much a people and a correspondence: a communication. Men "who were authorities, and therefore not scared" [[The falcondale collection]] about their respective fields, gathered in Mexico city to discuss the [[Dao]] between their fields; they understood that to be the most important, the most meaningful stuff (see [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]). They found that the connection was control, but it took them 3 years to understand what that word meant; thence they developed a subtle understanding of control, focusing on communication within the system.

	- [[anti-[[oscillation]]]]?
- Frameworks:
	- [[GAPPS]]
	- [[cynefin]]
	- [[confluence framework]]
	- [[[[viable system]] model]]
	- TODO the idea that a regulator must contain a model of its regulated is the [[good regulator theorem]]. The [[ethical regulator theorem]] [combines the good regulator theorem with the law of requisite variety and seven other requisites that are necessary and sufficient for a cybernetic regulator to be effective and ethical](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/8/4/53)
