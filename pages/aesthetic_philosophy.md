- Aesthetics emerges from the forms, from energy, information. 
  the aesthesis is the bundle of information, the informatic quanta; the first derivative of the form.
- A chair is a complex system. What emerges from the form of the chair---the aesthetic of chair---is the aesthesis of chair? the aesthetic of chair.
- To attempt an [[understanding]] without a [[definition]] is folly; to attempt a definition without an understanding is folly.
- To perform is transcendent:
  It is to lose oneself in an Aesthetic. It is to become that Aesthetic; to merge one's being with that Aesthetic.
- “Even if you could somehow translate a chair’s atoms into data points, would that get you to the important stuff?” [https://aeon.co/essays/do-you-know-your-stuff-the-ethics-of-the-material-world]
  A good way to traslate a chair's atoms into data is to sit on it.
